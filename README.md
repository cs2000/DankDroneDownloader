# DankDroneDownloader
Giving DJI (and now, others!) the D ;)

There are many tools in the drone community which allow you to flash firmware, however DJI, much like Apple, would rather you didnt do this and they remove older firmware to more tightly control what versions their users are running. This isnt something that sits comfortably with me, you should be allowed to choose what firmware runs on your own devices and as such, i present you with DankDroneDownloader, or DDD for short. DDD archives both old and new firmware for many popular DJI products & with (compaible 3rd party flashing software), will allow you to flash this firmware to your drone, camera, remote control or other random DJI device.

DDD is quite simply a custom written firmware download tool for popular DJI devices and Autel Drones. Not a windows user? Not a problem! DDD is also available in your (Chrome, Firefox or Edge) web browser over at http://dankdronedownloader.com/DDD2/app. Of course we reccomend using the windows applicaion for the best features, but the choice is yours.

- DDD Credits now allow users to see and download private FW files.
- DDD Credits balance is shown in the top right of the app.
- Upload Firmware button has been removed. Many users seemed to think this flashed the selected FW to the drone rather than its intended use. It was not being used any longer so had been removed from the app.

**DDD Credits?!?**
Many people do not realise, but DDD (currently) hosts just over 3,000 files, however only around 800 of these are made public, the files you see are the public FW files that DJI released. In the background we have a vast array of firmware DJI never release to the public, these are a mix of BETA, Factory Test & even Calibration firmware.<br />
These files have been shared with a select group of people for a long time now, however the time has come to make these available to everyone. From this release, i introduce DDD Credits.<br />
Credits can be purchased at the rate of $1 for 1 Credit via the new button in the app and can be redeemed on a download of a previously hidden file. This change is aimed at drone repair shops, tinkerers and anyone who is just curious! <br />
If you dont want to buy credits, thats fine, you will still see the public files in DDD as you have always done, but for those that do, the option is there. <br />

**How Does It Work?**
Credits are purchased via PayPal and your purchase is logged into the database, this is then processed and credits added to your account. You can press the green Refresh button to reload your balance.
Credits are tied to your CURRENT pc only, they CANNOT be shared, moved or transferred to any other machine. Reformatting your PC will result in the loss of your credit balance!!
Once you purchase credits, you simply begin a download you will be informed of the credits cost to download that firmware. If you accept, the download begins and the credits are deducted from your account. Simple!

**Note** All Public FW versions will remain on DDD for free, forever. This change is just aimed at certain people who may want, but never had access to the hidden files and allows them to access these and ultimately allow DDD to cover its own server bills. If you are one of the few people who already have access to the private files, you will still see the visual changes, but you will not need credits.

**Special Note** - From this version onwards, support for **ALL** older versions of DDD has had to be removed. This was of course a difficult decision as i know i will lose some users, but was done to better support the app moving forwards. I have tried my very best to support the all updates, right back to November 2019's Version 2.0 build 7266.24220 whilst at the same time making database and app changes to add new features, but it has gotten to an almost un-managable state and as such i had to assess the app and remove all legacy functions from the database. From here onwards, the app will check in with the server each time its opened to see if its version is still supported. When/if future large scale changes have to be made, the app will tell you your version is out-of-date and that it must be updated, if you refuse the update, the app will quit. Whilst i dont anticipate doing this on a regular basis, even i dont like to be forced to update apps, there comes a time that to continue to improve, i have to cut the old versions lose.<br>
However, we have an issue with the old versions out there, these dont have any idea about the server side changes and when i make the database swap they would simply die with a cryptic error message, this isnt good! My only way forward to force an update for these users is to purge the older database's content, but leave enough of the core structure out there so they can still connect. When these older versions are opened, the users will see a single firmware record telling people to update their app version. Im really sorry for having to force an update in this way, but in order to maintain the speed and reliability of the app, i had no other choice. You have my word this will be the only time i do it in this fashion as i understand the 'personal choice' around when you should have to update, but the changes im making, as always, are for the better and for you guys.<br>
The older database framework will stay up until around the end of June 2022, by then, im sure everyone who uses DDD would have opened it at least once and updated if they still wish to use the platform.
**TL:DR** Please update to this version to continue using DDD due to large scale database changes. cs2000<br>
<i>
- New 'Minimum Required Version' mechanism added to allow future app developments to have a smooth transition.
- Adverts no longer duplicate when you refresh the firmware list.
- Major back-end database overhaul.

- Overhaul of the update mechanism to allow it to work with the 'Minimum Required Version' system.

Version 2.6 <br>
Build 8042.27234<br>
SHA256 FA25B1197E6033FFC74ABF580D89EC3D8E58813054E6D8338139145943753D5F<br>
<i>
- Small GUI changes, just shuffled a few misc things around!
- Codebase cleanup, removing some of the old assets and functions used by previous versions of the app.

SHA256 DCFB6620B3F7BAE843D4C1D10563CADE0D1E2CC363D7D2D89603F4CD61CF0472<br>
<i>
- Fixed an issue where the Download button wouldnt become active for the first firmware in the list until you clicked on another firmware first. This meant it was impossible to download firmware for models where only a single firmware was available, this is now resolved.
</i>

Version 2.4 <br>
Build 7888.31293<br>
SHA256 69A98268E413D1F2B593006947A011E716AA2F5554C1C7A63F9D31B08EA1322D<br>
<i>
- Minor bug fixes.

**Donations**<br>
DDD welcomes donations. The servers dont cost a huge ammount to keep online, but do ofcourse have a cost. Theirs also my time in sourcing and adding new firmware and of course app updates, web system updates and keeping trackm of new models. I do it for the lulz, but if you wanted to donate some cash for my time or server costs, this is of course much appreciated & your name will be shown in the app and on the website. Thank you very much for donating if you choose to do so! :)

**Security**<br>
I have been informed that some AV apps very occasionally trigger when DDD is ran. This is most likely due to the way it downloads the files, the files are not downloaded to disk in the standard way until the "Save As" dialogue comes up, this could be seen by some AV algorithms as being a download that the user didn’t initiate.

Rest assured nothing nefarious is going on! I will try to remember (i am human) to update the link below with results for the current app version.
